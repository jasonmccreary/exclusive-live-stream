# BaseLaravel - Exclusive Live-stream

This repository contains [code we refactored](https://github.com/jasonmccreary/exclusive-live-stream/commit/fdcaa58c3b0fb430119622543da42b66756bdfa4?diff=split) during a live-stream exclusive to [BaseLaravel](https://baselaravel.com) subscribers. These were to tease the upcoming release of _BaseLaravel_ which will contain [ways to streamline your Laravel applications](https://twitter.com/i/events/1252651218662457347) and write code which is less complex and more readable.
